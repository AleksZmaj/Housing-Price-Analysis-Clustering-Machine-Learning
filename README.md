## Features
- **Descriptive Statistics:** Compute mean, median, standard deviation, skewness, and other summary statistics for house prices.  
- **Data Visualization:** Histograms, boxplots, heatmaps, barplots, and scatterplots for feature analysis.  
- **Regression Models:** Predict house prices using Decision Tree Regressor.  
- **Clustering:** KMeans clustering for grouping similar houses based on features.  
- **PCA (Principal Component Analysis):** Dimensionality reduction for visualization of clusters.  
- **Price Categorization:** Group houses into price categories (low, medium, high).  
- **GUI Integration:** Interactive interface built with Python Tkinter for exploring data and model outputs.
